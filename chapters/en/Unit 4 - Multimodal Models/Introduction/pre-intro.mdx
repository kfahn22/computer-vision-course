# Exploring Multimodal Text and Vision Models: Uniting Senses in AI

Welcome to the Multimodal Text and Vision Models unit! 🌐📚👁️ In this journey, we'll dive into the world where computers understand images, videos and text in a way how people use their senses together to understand things in the world around them. 

## Exploring Multimodality 🔎🤔💭

Our adventure begins with understanding why blending text and images is crucial, exploring the history of multimodal models, and discovering how self-supervised learning unlocks the power of multimodality. The unit discusses about different modalities with a focus on text and vision. In this unit we will encounter:

**1. Fusion of Text and Vision**
This chapter serves as a foundation, enabling learners to understand the significance of multimodal data, its representation, and its diverse applications laying the groundwork for the fusion of text and vision within AI models.

In this chapter, you will:
   - Understand the nature of real-world multimodal data coming from various sensory inputs that are important for human decision-making.
   - Explore practical applications of multimodality in robotics, search , Visual Reasoning etc., showcasing their functionality and diverse applications.
   - Learn about diverse multimodal tasks and models focusing on Image to Text, Text to Image, VQA, Document VQA, Captioning, Visual Reasoning etc.
   - Conclude with an introduction on Vision Language Models and cool applications including multimodal chatbots.

**2. CLIP and Relatives**
Moving ahead, this chapter talks about the popular CLIP model and similar vision language models. 
In this chapter you will:
   - Dive deep into CLIP's magic, from theory to practical applications, and explore its variations.
   - Discover relatives like Image-bind, BLIP, and others, along with their real-world implications and challenges.
   - Explore the functionality of CLIP, its applications in search, zero-shot classification, and generation models like DALL-E.
   - Understand contrastive and non-contrastive losses and exploring the self-supervised learning techniques.

**3. Transfer Learning: Multimodal Text and Vision**
In the final chapter of the unit you will:
   - Explore diverse multimodal model applications in specific tasks, including one-shot, few-shot, training from scratch, and transfer learning, setting the stage for an exploration of transfer learning's advantages and practical applications in Jupyter notebooks.
   - Engage in detailed practical implementations within Jupyter notebooks, covering tasks such as CLIP fine-tuning, Visual Question Answering, Image-to-Text, Open-set object detection, and GPT-4V-like Assistant models, focusing on task specifics, datasets, fine-tuning methods, and inference analyses.
   - Conclude by comparing previous sections, discussing benefits, challenges, and offering insights into potential future advancements in multimodal learning.
